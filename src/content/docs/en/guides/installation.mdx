# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (or Internet Explorer 11+)
- No additional dependencies required

## Installation Methods

### Via CDN (Recommended method)

Add the following code to your HTML to start using CounterJS right away:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/eulucastiagolt/counterjs@3.0.1/counter.min.js"></script>
```

## Basic Usage

1. Add the HTML element with the required attributes:

```html
<div data-counterjs data-counterjs-date="12/31/2025 23:59:59">
  Loading countdown...
</div>
```

2. Initialize CounterJS:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const counter = new CounterJS();
  counter.init();
});
```

## Verifying Installation

If you're using the CDN method, CounterJS will be available globally as `window.CounterJS`. You can verify the installation by adding the following to your HTML:

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    if (window.CounterJS) {
      console.log('CounterJS is loaded successfully!');
    } else {
      console.error('CounterJS failed to load');
    }
  });
</script>
```

If you see the success message in the console and the counter displays on your page, the installation was successful!
